//200 = "enjoy your JSON"
//301 = if the URL you requested is bad, but we know where it should be; your client should remember and correct this to use the new URL in future requests
//304 = if your client supports "ETag/If-None-Match" or "Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since" caching headers and the data have not changed since the last request
//404 = we try to tell you if the URL is malformed or the data requested is just not available (e.g., a username for a user that does not exist)
//410 = we know for certain that no data will ever be available at the URL you requested; your client should not request this URL again
//429 = we are refusing to interpret your request due to rate limits; see "Rate Limiting" above
